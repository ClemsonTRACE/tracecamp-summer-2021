# Time for the bootcamp

Now that you’ve completed the prework, it is time for the main event—learning React.js in Trace Camp. If you’re feeling overwhelmed, don’t worry. This prework was built as a reference, and you’re not meant to memorize or even understand all of it. We hope this prework exposed you to the fundamental building blocks of web development.

If you have questions, please create an issue in the repo. We will do our best to answer your questions, and will update the course to incorporate your feedback.
