## üìî Assignment

For this assignment you will be planning out a personal project to complete by this upcoming Sunday. In order to accomplish this in an organized manner, we are asking that you come up with your idea with a simple outline before this upcoming Tuesday. Here are some things that should be included in the outline...

- Simple explanation of your project idea
- What you want to have completed by Thursdays meeting
- Final features for your project by Sunday
- Start working on the project *or* sketch out how you want it to look like

Be sure to choose reasonable goals, as you will only have the week to work on it before you show them off on Sunday. If you are wondering if any of your goals are too ambitious, feel free to reach out for help in the questions channel or directly message any of the instructors.

***You will submit this project by responding to the thread we attach to your name in the Submissions channel on Discord!***
