## ðŸ“š Assigned Reading
- [MDN JavaScript Tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics) (~30 minutes)- This tutorial is a quick overview of JavaScript syntax and functionality, including how it can be used to manipulate websites. This tutorial works at a high level, and it is recommended that less experienced programmers also watch the video below to get a little bit more information on the finer details.


- (optional- ***recommended especially for first-time programmers***) [*JavaScript Tutorial for Beginners* by Programming with Mosh | YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6NZfCO5SIk) (~50 minutes)- This is a tutorial on basic JavaScript syntax and functionality. It goes into a bit more detail than the MDN tutorial above and is highly recommended for those who want more information. Try watching in 1.25x, 1.5x, or 1.75x speed, and pause as necessary to code along.
- (optional) [Tracecamp-docs: 06-html](https://github.com/ClemsonTRACE/tracecamp-summer-2021/blob/main/tracecamp-docs/06-html.md)- This includes a reference guide for working with HTML.
- (optional) [Tracecamp-docs: 08-css](https://github.com/ClemsonTRACE/tracecamp-summer-2021/blob/main/tracecamp-docs/08-css.md)- This includes a guide to CSS styling
- (optional) [Tracecamp-docs: 10-javascript](https://github.com/ClemsonTRACE/tracecamp-summer-2021/blob/main/tracecamp-docs/10-javascript.md)- This includes a reference guide for JavaScript syntax and common library functions. This is especially useful to refer back to when you want to understand JavaScript code that you are reading.
- (optional resource for experimenting with code) [JS Bin](https://jsbin.com/?html,output) - This is a site where you can experiment with coding in JavaScript online. It's a great resource as a sort of workspace for "scratch work."

## ðŸ“” Assignment
- [Silly Story Generator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Silly_story_generator)- Your project is to create a silly story generator using the MDN tutorial website. The silly story generator will have you working with JS functions to create a random story generator that includes the user's name and unit preferences (all will be explained on the site :)).
- Stretch Goal: style your Silly Story Generator using CSS, and make it pretty!
