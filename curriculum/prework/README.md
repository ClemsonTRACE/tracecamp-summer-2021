</h1>

Welcome to Trace Camp! This intro will help everyone start with a solid base. Please complete the assigned readings and the prework project below, and submit it via the Trace Camp Discord server ***by Saturday, July 24th*** to gain access to the camp!

## üéØ Learning Objectives

- Learn how to structure your webpage with HTML
- Learn how to style your webpage with CSS
- Learn how to save your project on GitHub

## üìî Project

Create your own icebreaker website. Be sure to include the following...

- Name
- Picture of yourself
- Major
- Hometown
- LinkedIn link
- If you have a pet, a photo
- Card grid of hobbies / interests
  - pictures
  - title
  - short description
- Something unique or random
- Publish source code publicly on [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- Deploy using [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site)

Post the link to the Github Pages page in the Discord after you have completed it!


## üìö Assigned Reading

We¬†don't¬†expect you to understand everything in these resources. Your goal is to complete the assignment, and learn as much as possible along the way. As with everything else in this bootcamp, you will only get out what you put into this assignment. Reach out to the instructors on Discord if you need help. We want to see you succeed!

First, follow our installation guide to install NodeJS (which lets us run JavaScript code outside of our web browser) and VSCode (the most popular and *objectively superior** text-editor for programming).

- [Tracecamp-docs: 01-installation [GitHub]](https://github.com/ClemsonTRACE/tracecamp-summer-2021/blob/main/tracecamp-docs/01-installation.md)

Second, use VSCode to code along while watching this ~40-minute video tutorial that walks through completing the project step-by-step (made by past instructor Jake Armstrong üôè). Like with all coding videos, make sure that you ***understand what you are doing*** as you complete this tutorial, and refer to the reading and reference documents if you don't understand anything. Also, Google is your friend. Use it relentlessly.

  - (optional) [Example of a completed assignment](https://jake-armstrong.surge.sh/)

Once you've completed everything above, you're done! However, this assignment is a basic introduction to building websites, and  it doesn't explain much about **_how_** a webpage works. If you want a more technical understanding of webpages (which will help you later on in the camp), read some of the articles below, and each out to the instructors on Discord with questions!
