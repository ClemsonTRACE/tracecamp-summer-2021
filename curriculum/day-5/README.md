## ðŸ“” Assignment

Create a persistent notes app, in which the user can type out text and save it for viewing later. There will need to be a large textarea input element for this functionality. Then the user will be able to save their work by clicking a button. When the page loads the next time, the text will be loaded without asking.

**Feature Requirements**

- A large text area for the user to type in
- Text in the text area is populated with any prior text (stored in local storage) if present.
- The user can save current text by clicking a button
- Make an indicator to show the user whether the current text is saved or not

**Optional Features**

- The user also has the option to enable auto-saving with a toggle or checkbox. This will save the input of the text field on every change of the text.
- Ability to make multiple notes. This can be either a set number of notes or a variable amount with addition or deletion.
- Add any flourish you like! if you can sell us on it we can award a point for it ðŸ™‚
