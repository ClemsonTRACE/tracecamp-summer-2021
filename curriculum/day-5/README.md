</h1>


## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

- The React component lifecycle (mount, unmount/cleanup) and how to use **useEffect** to hook into it
- How to save and retrieve data from the browser's **localStorage**
- How the **JSON.stringify** and **JSON.parse** functions can be used to convert js objects into string form

   - Don't worry if you don't understand _componentDidMount_, _componentDidUpdate_, and _componentWillUnmount_, they are old and unimportant because they have been replaced by useEffect.
- [Stringify and Parse](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/how-to-use-stringify-and-parse-in-javascript-6b637b571a32)
   - Breif introduction to the JSON.stringify and JSON.parse functions with a couple examples for each.

## ðŸ“” Assignment

Create a persistent notes app, in which the user can type out text and save it for viewing later. There will need to be a large textarea input element for this functionality. Then the user will be able to save their work by clicking a button. When the page loads the next time, the text will be loaded without asking.

**Feature Requirements**

- A large text area for the user to type in
- Text in the text area is populated with any prior text (stored in local storage) if present.
- The user can save current text by clicking a button
- Make an indicator to show the user whether the current text is saved or not
- The user also has the option to enable auto-saving with a toggle or checkbox. This will save the input of the text field on every change of the text.

**Optional Features**

- Ability to make multiple notes. This can be either a set number of notes or a variable amount with addition or deletion.
- Add any flourish you like! if you can sell us on it we can award a point for it ðŸ™‚
