GitHub Pages allows us to easily publish our projects on GitHub as websites. To learn how to create a repo on GitHub and add your project files, follow this guide: [tracecamp-docs/03-git.md](https://github.com/ClemsonTRACE/tracecamp-summer-2021/blob/main/tracecamp-docs/03-git.md)

First, make sure your GitHub repo is up to date buy pushing your changes to GitHub with your command line by running these commands:

`git add *`
`git commit -m "tracecamp prework submission*"`
`git push`

*\*The words between the quotes can be anything. It's supposed to be a description of the changes that you are committing.*

Then, publish your site to github pages following these steps:
- Go to your project's page on GitHub and click the project's "âš™ Settings" button 
  - <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44075075/125997604-eaf156e5-0051-4356-bb82-50f113901238.png" width="500"/>
- Click "Pages" at the bottom of the sidebar

- Click the dropdown box to select your page's source, and click "main," then click "save."

You should see a blue box that says "Your site is ready to be published at ____________." After a couple of minutes, if you click that link, it should show that your site has successfully been published.
