# Tailwind CSS

During this bootcamp, we encourage everyone to use Tailwind CSS. Tailwind CSS has some of the best [documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/) around. I encourage you to use the search feature to solve the problem you’re currently working on.

### Topics

In order to use Tailwind effectively, be sure to review:

- The box model
  - Padding
  - Border
  - Margin
- Display
  - Block
  - Inline-block
  - Inline
- Position
  - Relative
  - Absolute
    - Top, right, bottom, left, inset
  - Z-index
- Text
  - Alignment
  - Size
  - Color
  - Decoration
- Background colors
- Shadows
- Object fit
- CSS Grid or Flexbox
  - Box alignment

The Tailwind CSS documentation has examples and diagrams for most of these concepts. The tutorials below will also walk you through many of these concepts.

## Installation

For installation, feel free to reference the [official guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation). The fastest way is to include the CDN version in your html:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <link
      href="https://unpkg.com/tailwindcss@^2/dist/tailwind.min.css"
      rel="stylesheet"
    />
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

To reload your browser when you change your code, use VS Code’s live server [plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer). If you’re having trouble, feel free to use [tailwind play](https://play.tailwindcss.com/) (but be sure to save your code afterwards!).

When we learn react, we will install Tailwind CSS with postcss to unlock more features and customize the configuration. If you’re feeling adventurous, feel free to try postcss out now.

## Component libraries

Creating custom design and components is time-consuming. Feel free to take inspiration or code from these component libraries to speed up your workflow:
