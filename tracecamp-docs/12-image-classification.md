Feel free to explore [Lobe.ai](https://lobe.ai/), an app that helps you build machine learning models to categorize images. Watch the [tour](https://lobe.ai/tour/) to learn how to use it.

You will have the opportunity to use your custom model later on in the course. We are mentioning Lobe.ai now so that you have enough time to train your model, if you so desire.
