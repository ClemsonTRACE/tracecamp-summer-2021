# Installation

If you need help setting anything up let us know!

## Local

### NodeJS

In this course, we will be using Nodejs. Visit https://nodejs.org/en/ to install the current version. Or, use the package manager of your choice, such as [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) or [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/). To double check everything installed correctly, restart your terminal app and run `node -v`. We will mainly use NodeJS to run our command line tools.

### Text editor

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is currently the most popular editor, and, unfortunately, we require you to use it. Not because it’s better (it is), but because we will use the [Live Share Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare-pack) to help debug your code.

### Web browser

Please use a modern web browser: [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/), or [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/).

### Git and GitHub

If you don’t already have one, [sign up](https://github.com/) for a GitHub account. Most computers already have Git installed. Check by running `git --version` in your terminal. Otherwise, download and install it [online](https://git-scm.com/downloads) or with your package manager of choice. Using the Git Credentials Manager in the latest versions of Git will make syncing your account much easier.

## Online

If your computer is especially slow, you may want to work in VS Code Online, which allows you to run code on the cloud.

You may also use [VS Code Online](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services//github-codespaces/) or [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/). Unfortunately, [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/) does not support collaborative editing.
